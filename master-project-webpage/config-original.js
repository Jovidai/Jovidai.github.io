  '<p>When Samantha Robinson saw JYJ from a mile away in a spotting scope, she knew he would turn away soon, as he always did. He was shy and evasive, avoiding human beings for a long time.</p>' +
  '<p>JYJ is a piping plover, named after the number on his banded flag. Since he got his band in 2015, he was never trapped again by the researchers.</p>' +
  "<p>“Every plover is different.” Said Robinson, who started studying piping plovers and other shorebirds as a part of the Virginia Tech team in 2016.</p>" +
  "<p>“You have plovers that are gonna stick right next to their nest and let you know that they're upset with whatever you're doing right in your face, and there are other ones that all go fly away and hide and you'll never see them again.”</p>" +
  "<p>Piping plovers are among the two-thirds of bird species under the threat of climate change in North America. As a conservation-reliant species, which means their survival depends on active human management, piping plovers are in need of scientists’ monitoring, as well as public consciousness of protection. However, scientists recently found a certain amount of sea-level rise and hurricanes may benefit the shorebirds.</p>" +
  "<p>From 2013 to 2018, the team that Robinson was in captured and banded 152 adults and 353 chicks on the Fire and Westhampton barrier islands, New York. It’s a part of a series of studies on how piping plovers reacted to the change brought by Hurricane Sandy nine years ago. As the strong wind removed vegetation and expanded sandy area, new habitats suitable for piping plovers are created. But scientists also pointed out that hard facilities are hindering barrier islands from natural movement.</p>" +
  "<p>Piping plovers are brownish-grey shore birds with a round body, big black eyes, and a short, sharp orange black-tipped bill. They usually have shallow scrape nests in the softy sandy area with sparse vegetation along the shores. In late March, they will fly through the Atlantic Flyway to breed on the beaches of New York and Connecticut.</p>" +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>In the late 18th century, plovers were the popular target of hunters, as their feathers can be decorated on hats and clothes. With the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, they were under the protection and their population increased until 1950. Due to the habitats loss, as more beaches are developed for recreation, the number began to decline again. In 1985, the Atlantic Coast and Northern Great Plains populations were listed as threatened, and the population in the Great Lakes watershed was listed as endangered, according to <a href='https://www.fws.gov/species/piping-plover-charadrius-melodus'>US Fish & Wildlife service</a>.</p>" +
  "<h5 class='chart-title'>Although growing, the distribution of gaining population of the Atlantic Coast piping plover remains uneven</h5>" +
  "<h5 class='sub-title'>The New England recovery unit constitutes a stronghold, but neither New York-New Jersey nor southern states achieve the delisting goal.</h5>" +

  "<p>On the northeastern coast, scientists have studied their reproduction and behavior for decades. In 1985, <a href='https://www.vtshorebirds.org/our-vision'>Virginia Tech Shorebird Program</a> recruited a team of researchers to monitor and study breeding plovers in Virginia and Maryland.</p>";

let divChapter3 =
  "<p>It expanded to New York in 1992. They found that plover demography and growth are dependent on habitats availability, the amount of human recreation in the areas, and is influenced by storm disturbance.</p>" +
  "<p>After the historical Hurricane Sandy hit the Atlantic coast in 2012, they started to look into how it might change the overall suitability of nesting and how shorebirds respond to the change.</p>";


let divChapter4 =
"<p>In 2019, the research team led by Katie M. Walker published the first <a href='https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2771'>study</a> on the hurricane overwashing effect. They found that piping plover abundance increased 93% by 2018 from pre-Hurricane Sandy abundances on Fire Island and Westhampton Island, New York, with most pairs nesting in new habitats created by the storm.</p>" +
"<p>The study also found that some engineered habitats, including manipulated dunes and restoration areas, are gaining piping plover populations too. However, since these places were meant to reduce future overwash and increase human activities, the article suggested that dune development should not be considered a management strategy.</p>" +
"<p>Similarly, another U.S. Geological Survey research team led by Sara Zeigler, also found that a certain amount of increase in sea rise and increased likelihood of overwash can benefit the shorebirds. Based on the prediction model, as rates of shoreline erosion increase, Fire Island would become narrower and flatter, with more flooding in housing communities and businesses on the island. Instead, shorebirds like the piping plover would move to new habitats as long as hard structures like buildings or seawalls do not block sand movement.</p>"+

"<p>“I think we're still very much in the learning phase,” said Zeigler. She pointed out that scientists are struggling to find that balance between when a sea-level rise going to be healthy for some of these ecosystems and when is going to be too much. “We will get to a point inevitably where there's so much water and the storms are so powerful, that we're going to start to see our islands disintegrate. And we did see that in some places in the Gulf.”</p>"

"<p>Shelby Casas, the Coastal Program Associate at Audubon New York, also pointed out that the early storm during the nesting season can have fatal effects on the shorebirds. The flood can wash out a bunch of nests where birds have already laid eggs and the birds have to restart again.</p>" +
"<p>On July 7, Casas just finished an outreach lecture at Jones Beach Energy & Nature Center. When she took a walk on the west end of the beach afterward, she noticed a sign saying ‘no dog on this site’ was ripped off from the fence and broken from the middle.</p>" +
'<img src="images/shelby-sign.jpeg">' +
"<p>Mia Ramirez, Environmental Education Assistant from the Jones Beach State Park, who accompanied Casas for the walk, said that lots of people feel they have an ownership of the beach. “They're like, why do I have to worry about this bird? I've been taking my dog here for years and years and years…Why is someone telling me not to (do it)?”</p>"+
"<p>Casas said she was prepared for that and will implement a new sign. There are more signs simply telling people to stay out of the shorebird nesting area before. But this year, they try to add more explanatory notes, illustrations drawn by local school kids and pictures of the birds.</p>"+
'<img src="images/mia-sign.jpg">' +
"<p>“Our goal this year with the signs was kind of more to draw people in…and get the message across that we don't want dogs on these beaches, but to also explain why,” said Casas.</p>" +
"<p>This is a part of a three-month <a href='https://ny.audubon.org/news/can-individual-actions-save-threatened-birds-two-local-beaches-chosen-beach-nesting-bird-study'>study</a> to review the outcomes of different outreach efforts conducted by Audubon New York. Apart from putting up signs, the team has organized more frequent outreach activities compared to previous years, like tabling at multiple sites along the north and the south shore that have shorebird activity.</p>"

"<p>But the difficult part is to make people aware that the birds are actually here. Not many people know that piping plovers love walking on the sand and nesting right on the beach. They are good at camouflage - it’s hard to tell them from the sand from a distance.</p>" +
"<p>People might bring threats to the shorebirds without realizing it. Large pets, like unleashed dogs, can be mistaken as predators by plovers. To protect their chicks, they will pretend their wings are broken and lead the dogs away from the nest. But such a strategy may lead their nest open to real predators. And the trash left by beachgoers attracts raccoons and foxes, which can disturb and eat chicks.</p>" +
"<p>Moreover, some beachgoers might spot and disturb them on purpose. More than one researcher explained that they normally don’t share the nest location data with the public because they are afraid people will find the nest and get too close to them.</p>" +
"<br></br>"+
"<p>Now, Robinson has a new role to play, the Program Manager of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. She said the reason behind this is the feeling of disconnect between science and management and wanted to make a difference.</p>" +
"<p>Ramirez is considering pursuing her master's degree in community psychology. She realizes it’s important to engage the public and persuade them to change their behavior.</p>" +
"<p>In Connecticut and New York, piping plovers and boat-tailed grackles are listed as high climate-vulnerable species, according to the National Audubon Survival by Degree Report. The sea level rise can permanently consume coastal habitats.</p>" +
"<p>More than one ornithologist expressed concerns about the bird species. Some of them are already rare birds that have been identified as species of concern, like American oystercatchers. “And they are going to be facing an increasingly difficult battle of having their nest survive as the intensity of storms increase,” said Dustin Partridge, the director of Science and Conservation at Audubon’s New York chapter, a community that works for the protection of wild birds and habitat.</p>" +
"<p>Partridge said these birds lack attention because people are always thinking about urban birds in Central Park. But it’s also important to look at the shores, as the city is largely islands, he said.</p>"

let divChapter7 =
"<p>In Jamaica Bay, one hour’s drive from Manhattan, residents can feel and at times see the threat of sea level rise and increasingly intense coastal storms. So do the birds. The wetlands here are stops where thousands of birds congregate every year during migration. However, when Hurricane Sandy came nine years ago, sea waters broke the bank and went into the west pond, which was one of two freshwater ponds. Now, at least 4 million dollars have been spent to repair the breach, turning it back into a welcoming spot for birds and wildlife.</p>";
