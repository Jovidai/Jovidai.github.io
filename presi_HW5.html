    <h2 >--- Find a dataset.</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/padhmam/qs-world-university-rankings-2017-2022">QS World University Rankings 2017 - 2022</a></p>
    <p>The dataset I gained is about the QS World University Rankings from 2017 to 2022 to discover and explore the world's leading academic institutions, which was acquired by scraping the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings?utm_source=topnav">QS World University Rankings</a> website with Python and Selenium.</p>
    <p>QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of global university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds. The QS ranking receives approval from the International Ranking Expert Group (IREG), and is viewed as one of the three most-widely read university rankings in the world. QS publishes its university rankings in partnership with Elsevier.</p>

    <h2> --- Describe the different variables / columns available in the dataset.</h2>

    <p>
        This dataset contains university data from the year 2017 to 2022. It has a total of 15 features.
        <li>university - name of the university</li>
        <li>year - year of ranking</li>
        <li>rank_display - rank given to the university</li>
        <li>score - score of the university based on the six key metrics mentioned above</li>
        <li>link - link to the university profile page on QS website</li>
        <li>country - country in which the university is located</li>
        <li>city - city in which the university is located</li>
        <li>region - continent in which the university is located</li>
        <li>logo - link to the logo of the university</li>
        <li>type - type of university (public or private)</li>
        <li>research_output - quality of research at the university</li>
        <li>studentfacultyratio - number of students assigned to per faculty</li>
        <li>international_students - number of international students enrolled at the university</li>
        <li>size - size of the university in terms of area</li>
        <li>faculty_count - number of faculty or academic staff at the university</li>
    </p>

    <h2> --- Start thinking about how you could visualize that data.</h2>

    <p>
        <li>The first idea that I want to use this dataset to visualize is to figure out the top 10 universities in the world. I could create a bar chart to show the top 10 universities globally.</li>
        <br>
        <li>My second visualization idea is to sort these different countries' universities in their own countries and make a map of them to show their location to make readers know which countries have the most universities in the QS World Rankings. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Thirdly, I want to use this dataset to explore which country is preferred by international students because the international students' occupation is also a critical factor in the QS World Rankings. I will use this dataset to visualize a scatterplot or a line plot.</li>
